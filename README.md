# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern SQL data warehouse.  
It covers the full **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process**, database modeling, and analytics.  
The project uses a structured approach to transform raw data into actionable insights for business intelligence.

---

## Key Features
- Built a **data warehouse** using SQL with fact and dimension tables.  
- Implemented **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for efficient data processing.  
- Designed and executed **ETL pipelines** to extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources.  
- Generated **analytical reports** to derive insights from structured datasets.  
- Applied **SQL querying, aggregation, and joins** for data analysis.

## Repository Contents
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DataWarehouseDatabase.sql` | SQL scripts to create tables, relationships, and populate sample data. |
| `ETL_Scripts.sql` | SQL scripts performing ETL transformations and data loading. |
| `Schema_Diagram.png` | Diagram showing database schema and table relationships. |
| `Sample_Reports.sql` | Example queries for analytics and reporting. |

## Database Schema
- **Fact Tables:** Store measurable events or transactions.  
- **Dimension Tables:** Store descriptive attributes for analysis (e.g., Products, Customers, Time).  
- **Relationships:** Fact tables linked to dimension tables to enable analytics and reporting.  

---

## Example Queries
- Aggregate sales or metrics by product, region, or time.  
- Join fact and dimension tables to analyze trends.  
- Identify top-performing products or categories.  
- Transform raw data into structured tables for reporting.
