# Bronze Layer Schema Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the tables within the `bronze` schema. This layer holds raw, unprocessed data ingested directly from source systems (CRM and ERP). The structure mirrors the source as closely as possible, with minimal transformations.

## üîó Inferred Relationships

  * **Customers and Sales:** `crm_cust_info` joins with `crm_sales_details` on `cst_id` = `sls_cust_id`.
  * **Products and Sales:** `crm_prd_info` joins with `crm_sales_details` on `prd_key` = `sls_prd_key`.
  * **Customer Enrichment:** `crm_cust_info` can be enriched with `erp_loc_a101` and `erp_cust_az12` using `cst_key` = `cid`.
  * **Product Enrichment:** `crm_prd_info` can be enriched with `erp_px_cat_g1v2` using `prd_key` = `id`.

## üìù General Notes & Observations

  * **Data Consistency:** The bronze layer preserves inconsistencies from the source, such as different naming conventions for customer IDs (`cst_id`, `cst_key`, `cid`). These will be standardized in the Silver layer.
  * **Date Formatting:** Dates in the `crm_sales_details` table are stored as `INT`. They will require casting and transformation into a standard `DATE` format for analysis.
  * **Data Integrity:** This DDL script does not define primary keys, foreign keys, or other constraints. This is a common practice in the bronze layer to ensure that ingestion processes do not fail due to data quality issues at the source. Data validation and integrity checks are typically enforced in the Silver layer.
  * **Redundancy:** The gender column appears in both `crm_cust_info` (`cst_gndr`) and `erp_cust_az12` (`gen`). A data cleaning strategy will be needed to consolidate this information.
